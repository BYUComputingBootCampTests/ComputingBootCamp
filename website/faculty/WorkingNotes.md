## Get a VM - DELETE
- The get VM doesn't really make sense any more. 

## Create a VM - RENAME, UPDATE, NO_SELF_PACED, NO_LECTURE
- The create VM only makes sense if we don't have sufficient seats for our students since  I propose we plan on in-person and insist our students come in. Proposal: 
    - Point them at an on-line tutorial to do the clean instalon really how to do a clean install 
    - Add fold the Customize Your VM stuff into the end of this
    - Move FPGA-specific stuff elsewhere
    - Rename to "Create and Set Up a Linux VM"
- In the end, its existence is only for reference - no need to lose the info, may come in handy

## Customize Your VM - MOVE_CONTENT_ELSEWHERE, DELETE
- Move the FPGA-specific stuff
- Delete outdated stuff (RapidSith)
- Move good stuff into topic above

## VS Code - CREATE, SELF_PACED, BY_WHOM?
- I had students balk at using VS code last summer.  I plan on telling them they ing them use something without a good debugger was not worth it.
- Need to flesh this out, have listed a few topics on the page itself.

## Linux Stuff - SELF_PACED
- Clearly needs fixing up - was the result of a good 4 minutes of my time last spring...
- Should point at some good tutorials
- Should decide what we really want them to know, I would hope we could go beyond the 220/330 level treatment and expect them to actually know command line.  
- But that begs the question - why, especially given our conversation of today? I thus recommend we have some serious command line stuff to maybe motivate it - would want them to be things that would be quite difficult graphically.  See bottom of that page for some new things we might could add....
