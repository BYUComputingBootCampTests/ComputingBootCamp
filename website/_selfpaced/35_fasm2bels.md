## Possible Follow-Up Activities

Using fasm2bels would be a useful activity because it would:

* It is a 2nd Symbiflow repo with its own install instructions to get them use to the idea of Symbiflow having multiples
* Provide an example of a program that uses the prjxray database
* Show them Verilog schematics and introduce Xilinx primitives - something they will have never seen before
* Help them see the complete cycle - they could go from behavioral Verilog --> Vivado --> bitstream --> FASM --> Verilog Schematic --> Vivado --> bitstream


TODO: find links to add about fasm2bels, add an overview section, make this page longer and more detailed
