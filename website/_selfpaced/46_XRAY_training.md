# Level 1

To complete a level one training you must create a profile on the mri website. First, log into mri.byu.edu with your byuid and click on profile. Click add profile and fill in your information. You will later be added to the account named Wirthlin which is where we charge all of our expenses. Then you must complete 2 training modules. Follow [this](https://irb.byu.edu/citi-training) tutorial to complete the CITI training on animal and human testing. Though our research does not use these as test subjects, you have to complete this training. Second, you have to complete the [Y-training](https://byu.myabsorb.com/#/online-courses/d08ff47e-72ca-410d-87f5-0d82a5b57dc9) on MRI safety in order to be in the building. This should only take about an hour to complete. To maintain your training you should complete the Y-train module once a year. After this you should screenshot your certificates of completion and send the pictures to mri@byu.edu

# Level 2

To complete level 2 training Dr. Wirthlin has to go to mri.byu.edu and request you as a level 2. Once that is complete you have to read through the [safety manuals](https://github.com/byuccl/Altium_PCB/tree/master/XRAYSafetyManuals). The zip file can also be found in the Altium repo in XRAYSafetyManuals if you have it on your local computer already. These files are very long and quite extensive. You mostly need to remember what the safety features are and can skim through the rest. Finally you will complete a walkthrough with the person who is over the CT trainings. As of right now this person is Jhon and his email is jatsia96@gmail.com. If this has changed you should be able to email mri@byu.edu and schedule it there. Make sure you have completed all previous steps and this will be far simpler. The walkthrough should take place in the Mcdonald building and you should be able to bring a board if you have one you want to scan. Once this is complete your status will be updated to level 2 and they will print an ID for you that you have to wear when inside the building. This should be ready to pick up a few days after completing your training. The cost to print the ID is $10 which should be charged to the Wirthlin account.

Congratulations on completing your training!
