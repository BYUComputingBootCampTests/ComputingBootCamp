# How to create Automated Pass-off Tests
In order to award badges, the BYU Computing Boot Camp is currently considering using a mixture of "project" based assessments and "code" based assessments. For the project-based
assessments, users will create an end-product that will involved the subject taught, but will also involve alot of creativity on their part. This will require these projects to
be reviewed by human staff of the Computing Boot Camp website (probably Undergraduates), who will then manually award the badge if they believe the project proves that the user
has sufficient knowledge in the subject. However, the code-based assessments will require the user to create software that conforms to specified instructions, meaning that an
automated pass-off test can be used to evaluate the user's work and then award the badge. Whether a project-based assessment or a code-based assessment is used to award the badge
for a specified sub-module will be up to the discretion of the staff of the BYU Immerse Program.

This guide will attempt to explain how to create an automated pass-off test in order to implement a code-based assessment. This is a complicated guide, and may require a couple of
read-throughs for you to fully understand it, so don't lose hope if parts of this are going over your head. In addition, I'm not a perfect writer, so if something doesn't seem
to be adding up, a quick Google search should be enough to fill in the gaps.
