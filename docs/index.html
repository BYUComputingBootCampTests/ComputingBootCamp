        <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his is the web page for Immerse Bootcamp.   <br>

        Just started editing this.  <br>
        
        Needs some graphical design work but the bootcamp pieces from last year 
        are in the sidebar and are being edited.

        This bootcamp serves two purposes in terms of topical content. The first is general computing topics such as Linux and VM's, Git, cmake, etc.  The second is FPGA-specific topics such as Tcl/Vivado and prjxray.  These two groups of topics can be used independently.  That is, they do not contain dependencies on each other other and so you could use them independently of each other.
