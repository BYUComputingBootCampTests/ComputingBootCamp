This is the home page for FPGA Bootcamp.  Our goal is to expose you a number of the topics you need to do to come up to speed on so you can contribute to FPGA-based projects.  In our projects, everything we do somehow has CAD tools for FPGA design as an element.  That is, almost everything we focus on results in the creation of some kind of software to work with FPGA designs.  Some examples include: the development of open-source FPGA CAD tools, the development of CAD tools to increase the "X" of existing FPGA designs where "X" could be reliability or security or something else.  

Unless instructed otherwise, our intent is that you work through the modules below in sequence.
